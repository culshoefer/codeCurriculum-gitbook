Introduction to python and small-scale game development with PyGame
=======

##Use of these resources: Description
This introduction to (Object-Oriented-) Programming with Python (and PyGame) is divided into four distinct chapters.
1. Programming basics in python
    1. Hello, world! and getting started with python
    2. Variables and types
    3. Conditionals
    4. Loops
    5. Arrays/Lists
2. Advanced programming concepts
    1. Functions
    2. Classes
    3. Modules
3. Application of programming skills in PyGame and learning application design
    1. Tutorial: How to build <Insert game name> from scratch
    2. Tutorial: Hints at how to turn pseudocode/high-level views into real code
4. Final project intended for exams/voluntary projects of ambitious students
##Intended audience and learning outcome
These resources are different from many other tutorials on python or PyGame. We believe that the most valuable lessons are those which actually have a practical application. As such, we want students to experience fast feedback and actually include a final project (or multiple projects) into our curriculum.
Throughout the course, we aim to move to PyGame as quickly as possible while still being able to understand what is going on. This is because we believe that students can get quite frustrated quickly if concepts are not properly introduced. At the same time, it means that the learning curve is steep. Finally, this is why this curriculum is intended for **16 years and up**.

Continuing in this manner, we do not understand this project to be about theoretical digressions. We want to keep it close to the application, without any additional distraction. As the audience is quite old, we do not want to include a framework story, but keep it to the topic and provide guidance throughout. From our perspective, in this age, it is more about **discovering your own capabilities** than adapting a given framework. However, all in all, in our opinion, students should not be expected to just jump into coding. From our own experience, it is very hard to come up with good project ideas by oneself. This is why we include a third and fourth chapter that gradually builds up knowledge and student expectation on how to think about problems and gradually lays the responsibility for program design in the hands of the student.

What we want from students is to be able to understand the very core concepts of programming like control flow and branching and to be able to apply them together with more advanced concepts such as classes and modules. Ideally, students should be able to come up with solutions on their own and
