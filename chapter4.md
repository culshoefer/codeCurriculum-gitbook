# Fourth Chapter: Capstone project
Welcome to chapter four! If you made it till here, you already know
alot about programming in python with pygame (yay!)
In this final chapter, you will implement your own version of the 
Whack-a-Mole on your own. There will be a solution provided, but keep
in mind, that there are multiple ways of implementing this game in 
pygame.

## Rules
The rules of Whack-A-Mole are as following:
* The board has 16 holes
* When the game starts, a random number of moles should pop up
* Every time the player hits a mole, the hitted mole should disappear and
* New moles should appear at the surrounding holes which are empty
* If there are already moles, they should disappear
* The player wins if there are no moles left on the board
