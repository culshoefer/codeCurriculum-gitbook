# Fourth Chapter: Capstone project
Welcome to chapter four! If you made it until here, you already know
a lot about programming in python with PyGame (yay!)
In this final chapter, you will implement your own version of the
Whack-a-Mole on your own. There will be a solution provided, but keep
in mind that there are multiple ways of implementing this game in
PyGame.

## Rules
The rules of Whack-A-Mole are as follows:
* The board has 16 holes
* When the game starts, a random number of moles should pop up
* Every time the player hits a mole, the hit mole should disappear and
* New moles should appear at the surrounding holes which are empty
* If there are already moles, they should disappear
* The player wins if there are no moles left on the board
